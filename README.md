# Attendance-Base-System-Using-Face-Detection
This is a Face Recognition-based Attendance System built in C++ using OpenCV.
It captures and recognizes faces through a webcam to mark attendance for both students and teachers. Attendance records are saved in CSV files along with timestamps and photo evidence, making the system reliable and easy to track.

This project provides a hands-on introduction to face detection, file handling, and real-time video processing in C++. It's a great starting point for beginners interested in computer vision, OpenCV, and automation through C++.
